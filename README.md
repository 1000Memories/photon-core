===========

On the fly photo processing

Photon-core provides a JAX-RS resource (`com.thousandmemories.photon.photon-core.PhotoResource`) that processes (resizes, rotates, and crops) image files on the fly.

Read more about it on our blog post (TODO: link blog post after it's live) or see it in use in an example at https://github.com/1000Memories/photon-example

(TODO: show basic usage information)
